## Inspiration
While the world battles with water scarcity, in urban areas water leakage is the biggest source of water wastage. Two of the most common sources of water damage are leaking pipes and burst water pipes. Unfortunately, we often cannot see pipe damage until it is too late. In order to prevent serious damage being done through faulty pipes, it is essential to install a water leak system that will detect a problem before disaster hits .Our sensor based water leakage detector would detect variations in the flow of water and would give an alert.This will help to keep a strict check on the leakages caused in pipes.

## Overview 
An efficient tool that detects water leakage in pipes which in effect helps in avoiding water wastage.

## Summary
This project mainly aims at prevention of the water wasted due to leaks in pipes. Water leakage involves unnecessary expenses in pumping and water treatment costs; it should be added that costs necessary for repairing broken pipes of any size should be added to this list; of course, maintaining a system regularly at an accepteable level is prefereable to apply extensive rehabilitation programs to problematic systems.

## Conclusion
Generally, cities with leaking systems get informed by the drought earlier than cities with strong systems. Taking necessary precautions like installing a leakage system beforehand, a lot of time and money can be saved. Also if almost every leak gets prevented in the future, then it might contribute towards conserving water efficiently and keep in check the wastage of water. In times where water crisis has become a burning issue, every possible attempt to conserve water would be beneficial and water leakage systems head exactly towards that direction. With proper implementation and executing advanced projects based on this idea, leakage cases can be brought 
to 0%.
